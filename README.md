# QLCpy

Generates questions about concrete constructs and patterns in a given Python
program. These questions (including answering options) can be posed to a
learner to practice introductory programming. These questions include elements
to develop program comprehension and program tracing.

Automatic generation enables systems to pose the generated questions to leaners
about their own programs that they previously programmed. Such Questions About
Learners' Code (QLCs) may have self-reflection and self-explanation effects
that are of interest in computing education research.

The concept of Questions About Learners' Code (QLCs) is first introduced by Lehtinen et al. in
[Let's Ask Students About Their Programs, Automatically](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00054).
